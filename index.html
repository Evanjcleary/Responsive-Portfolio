    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p> My name is Evan Cleary. I was born in an outskirts of Philadelphia called Ambler, PA. I am one of 6 siblings in
      my family. I have 1 twin, 2 brothers, 3 sisters and 60 cousins. All of them are older then me, including my twin.
      She lives far away now.</p>
    <p> I graduated college in 2014 where I was President of the service organization I was a part of. I then was
      selected to be a Business developer for a Bio-Tech start-up. I was tasked with running the seed-funding initiative, which involved presenting the prototype and business plan to Angel Investors. I later
      went on to start my own company which is steady and growing. Though this particular business, while profitable, is
      not fulfilling my creative aspirations.</p>
    <p>Growing up I've had many ideas for utilizations of technology. I have notebooks of ideas stacked in my home, but
      never the tools or means to execute on them. I plan to learn everything I can about computer programming so I can
      build more start-up companies. I hope to make many different web applications and mobile applications with my
      skillset to start to build a solid holding company that generates revenue from these minor applications.</p>
    <p> Then, I have one idea in particular that I believe can be very popular. So I intend to work as hard as I can
      until I develop the skillset necessary to carry out that idea. </p>
